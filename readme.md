# Prosper Loan Data - Visualization
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

## Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In [the first part](https://github.com/ekaraseva/4-Prosper-Loan-Visualization/blob/master/exploration_EKaraseva.ipynb)  Python visualization libraries is used to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In [the second part](https://github.com/ekaraseva/4-Prosper-Loan-Visualization/blob/master/slide_deck_EKaraseva.ipynb), a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that was discovered is made. 

### Dataset
Prosper Marketplace is America's first peer-to-peer lending marketplace, with over 7 billion USD in funded loans. Borrowers request personal loans on Prosper and investors (individual or institutional) can fund anywhere from 2,000 USD to 35,000 USD per loan request. Investors can consider borrowersâ€™ credit scores, ratings, and histories and the category of the loan. Prosper handles the servicing of the loan and collects and distributes borrower payments and interest back to the loan investors. [ref. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosper_Marketplace]

On November 24, 2008, the SEC found Prosper to be in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. As a result of these findings, the SEC imposed a cease and desist order on Prosper ... In July 2009, Prosper reopened their website for lending ("investing") and borrowing after having obtained SEC registration for its loans ("notes"). After the relaunch, bidding on loans was restricted to residents of 28 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Borrowers may reside in any of 47 states, with residents of three states (Iowa, Maine, and North Dakota) not permitted to borrow through Prosper

The data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

## Summary of Findings

By examining single variables we saw that Borrower Rate/APR is normally distributed with mean at about 18-20%. The user score range looks a bit skewed left, with few strange gaps. Furthermore, we observed quite a big percentage of non-performing (charged off, defaulted, Past-Due) loans in the data. As an investor, you should be conscious about performance of your money. The model that provide such high amount of bad loans requires improvement.

The highest average Prosper Borrower Rate had its maximum in q4 2010, after that it decreased. 

Bad performing rate is quite high over the years and didn't improve a lot after 2008 financial crisis.

Borrower Rate is strongly dependent on Prosper Rate and has different behaviour for users with different income. 

We saw clear different patterns of Borrower Rate for different loan duration over the years and it gives some understanding on how choice between different loan durations is made.

We saw clear difference in relation between Loan Amount and Monthly Payment with regards to different loan durations.
